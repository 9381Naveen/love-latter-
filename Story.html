        <h1>To My Dearest Pranitha</h1>
        <p>
            It’s hard to believe that five long years have gone by. Five years without your touch, without your smile, without your laugh lighting up my world. In all this time, not a single day has passed where I haven’t thought of you, longed for you, and missed you with every fiber of my being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every morning I wake up with the hope that today might be the day I see you again. Every night I fall asleep with your memory in my mind, replaying the moments we shared like the sweetest dream I can never forget. These five years have been a journey, a test, and a promise to myself — a promise that I would become the person you always believed I could be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve missed you, Pranitha, more than words can express. I’ve missed the way you make the world brighter just by being in it, the way your voice feels like home no matter where I am. Without you, everything has felt incomplete, like a song missing its melody. But the thought of you has kept me going, has driven me to be better, stronger, and more deserving of the love we share.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve spent every moment building a future for us, one where we can finally be together without any barriers. I’ve worked harder than I ever thought I could, not because I had to, but because I wanted to — for you, for us. I’ve missed so many things, but what I’ve missed the most is you. And I can’t wait for the day I no longer have to say “I miss you,” because you’ll be right here, filling the empty spaces with your presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I’m not perfect, and I’ve made mistakes along the way, but I’m ready to spend the rest of my life making up for them. I want to create new memories, to fill our days with laughter, love, and endless joy. I want to show you how much you mean to me, how much you’ve always meant to me. These five years were a test of my patience, my love, and my dedication — and I’m ready to show you that my heart has never wavered.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you, Pranitha, more than words can say. And I will wait, no matter how long it takes, because you are worth every second, every minute, every year. My love for you has only grown deeper, and I can’t wait for the moment we are together again, without any distance or time keeping us apart.
        </p>
        <div class="signature">
            Forever and always yours,
